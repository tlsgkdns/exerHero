This project was developing phone game using arduino for "Creative Design" class
I bought Unity blootooth plugin, And developed a simple game by Unity.
Game is only played by touch and exercise(PushUp, LegRaise, Squat)
By exercise you can get game resources and battle with monsters
I only used text and buttons to show the game Progress
Although, There was some bugs, but was successful that I got A+ in that class
Unfortunately, I don't have arduino device to connect this game now.
